disk usage percentage for the root file system ((root of disk))

df -h: display disk space usage information. 
The -h flag stands for "human-readable", and it tells df to use units such as "G" for gigabytes and "M" for megabytes.

The output df -h is then piped to the awk command, which is used to process text data.
I've ve written awk command in single quotes.

The pattern '$NF=="/"' is used to match lines in the output of df -h where the last field ($NF) is equal to "/" (the root file system).

'{printf "%s\t\t", $5}' is then executed for each matching line.
printf is used to print the fifth field ($5) of the matching line (i.e., the percentage of disk usage) and a tab character (\t) is used to format the output.

The output of the awk command is then assigned to the disk variable using command substitution and the syntax $(...), where the ... is the command that outputs the desired value.

So, overall, this command uses df to get the disk usage information and awk to extract the usage percentage for the root file system, which is then stored in the disk variable.
