top -bn1: runs the top utility in non-interactive mode and with a single iteration, which means it will only gather system information once and then terminate. 
(top command is a system monitor that shows information about the processes and resource usage on a system.)

grep load: takes the output of top and searches for any lines containing the word "load". 
The "load" here means system load average (measure of the amount of work a computer system is doing)

awk '{printf "%.2f%%\t\t\n", $(NF-2)}': takes the output from the previous grep command and uses awk to extract and format the system load average value. 




{printf "%.2f%%\t\t\n", $(NF-2)}: prints the second-to-last field ($(NF-2)) of the input line with a format of %.2f%%\t\t\n. 
The %.2f specifies that the field should be printed as a floating-point number with two decimal places, 
followed by a percent sign (%) to indicate that this is a percentage value, and then two tabs (\t\t) to format the output.
output of this is then assigned to the variable cpu. So, cpu will contain a formatted string that represents the current system load average as a percentage, such as 3.57%.
