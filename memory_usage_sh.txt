free -m: prints out information about the system's memory usage. 
The -m option: = output should be in megabytes.

awk: extract specific piece of information from output of free



'NR==2{printf "%.2f%%\t\t", $3*100/$2 }': awk command that prints the memory usage as a formatted string.

NR==2: tells awk to only perform the command on the second line of the input. 
The output of free has two lines of information: the first line shows the total memory, and the second line shows the used memory.

{printf "%.2f%%\t\t", $3*100/$2 }: executed on the second line of the input.


printf "%.2f%%\t\t": This is a printf statement that prints out a formatted string. 
The %.2f specifies that a floating-point number with two decimal places should be printed,
%% prints out a literal % character. 
The \t\t prints out two tab characters to separate the output from the next metric.
$3*100/$2: arithmetic expression that calculates the percentage of memory that is being used. 
$2 is the total memory, and $3 is the used memory.


memory=: assigns the output of the command to a variable called memory. 
The $(...) = "command substitution", takes the output of the command and assigns it to the variable.

echo "Memory Usage: $memory": prints out the memory usage to the console in a human-readable format. 
The $memory variable is replaced with the formatted string calculated by the awk command.
